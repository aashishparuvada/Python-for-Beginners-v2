# To print something on to the terminal or console, we use print statements. We can either use a single quote or double to represent a string.
# More on strings in the strings file

# You also can have string written in triple single or triple double quotes, generally used for Long paragraphs or in DOCSTRINGS (will learn in functions).

print('''
