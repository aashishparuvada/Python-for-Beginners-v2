# Python for Beginners v2

Welcome to **Python for Beginners v2** 🎉

This repository is a refreshed and more structured version of my earlier repository **Python for Beginners** which was created years ago. It’s designed for anyone who is starting their journey with Python. Each file in this repo focuses on a **single concept** in Python, making it easy to learn step by step.

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

* Each `.py` file demonstrates **one Python concept** with clear explanations in the code.
* The concepts are arranged in a **progressive order** — starting from the basics and moving towards more advanced topics.

Example file naming convention:

```
01_variables.py  
02_data_types.py  
03_conditionals.py  
04_loops.py  
05_functions.py  
...  
```

## 🐍 Topics Covered

This repo covers majority of Python fundamentals, such as:

* ✅ Variables & Data Types
* ✅ Strings & String Operations
